-change indexing for non-PAM search (accept no PAM as input, PAM len=0)
use this as notes:
    positive strand - standard FASTA
    negative strand - reverse complemented FASTA
    try to use only one index for any sequence with len<=fix_length(30-40bp)
    (NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTE IN SPEED OR SPACE SAVING WITH THIS OPERATION)

-fix bed file reading in GUI
-big report creation with summarized data for single guides (guide|on-target|total_count|cfd_score|crista_score)
