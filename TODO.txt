-update PAM extraction to avoid memory corruption with PAM seq longer than 4bp
-change indexing for non-PAM search (accept no PAM as input, PAM len=0)
use this as notes:
    positive strand - standard FASTA
    negative strand - reverse complemented FASTA
    try to use only one index for any sequence with len<=fix_length(30-40bp)
-update transcript annotation to report strand (transcript(-), transcript(+))
-update annotation phase to use strand in global BED file
